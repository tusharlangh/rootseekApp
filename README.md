# 🌱 RootSeek

RootSeek is a reflective memory-based app that helps users document their thoughts, experiences, emotions, and learnings. By analyzing written memories ("roots"), the app reveals patterns, themes, and tone over time — helping users rediscover parts of themselves that may have faded or gone unnoticed.

RootSeek is **not** an AI coach or advice engine. It doesn't tell you how to live — it simply shows you _you_.
