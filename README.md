# 🌱 RootSeek

RootSeek is a reflective memory-based app that helps users document their thoughts, experiences, emotions, and learnings. By analyzing written memories ("roots"), the app reveals patterns, themes, and tone over time — helping users rediscover parts of themselves that may have faded or gone unnoticed.

RootSeek is **not** an AI coach or advice engine. It doesn't tell you how to live, it simply shows you _you_.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Pattern Insight**<br/>
  Pattern Insight searches across roots and finds a pattern that is reccuring that could be time bases, location based or content based so you can act not reflect.

- **🧵 Theme Thread View**  
  Theme Thread View chooses the top-most talked about themes and finds progression, and shows you the role of each particular root and how its growth plays in the overall journey.

- **📘 Singe Root View**  
  The Single Root View uses horizontal scrolling to create a timeline like experience, letting you move through your memories as if you’re journeying through time. The audio in the background makes it more immersive.
